	A common question regarding color perception is whether or not people perceive colors the same, despite naming them the same thing. For example, your ‘red’ might be different from my ‘red’, despite the fact that we label the color the same thing. Because words are essentially just labels, so how do we know whether or not we perceive things the same way, even though we label them the same way? What is love? Is what I call love the same and what you call love? is what I call art the same as what I call art? Is my concept of existence the same as yours? Essentially, there is no way to really make sure that we are accurately communicating with each other. And yet, somehow, everyday, we do successfully communicate with each other. So my definitions must at least be close to your definitions. But there’s still this strange, ambiguous space that exists between word and meaning, that’s small enough to enable communication, but still greater than zero.
