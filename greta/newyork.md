### Poem for everyone in New York and the past two days

A walnut fell to the ground and a Pigeon ate it\
A Rat scuttled\
to the throbbing yellow pound\
cake in torn-open\
plastic sheath

*It is a flash over the blackest brack\
It is the Animal that rules me*

Urban planning in shape of dollar sign\
The S is water and The Line\
through it is a wild bed\
of six-foot tall cilantro\
sprigs

*It is a Pipe Dream*

Here I am again, the room rank\
with newness I\
am elbowed in the rib\
while pushing a handle down

*I want to dig into my foot\
into Maslow’s sharpest point\
I want to dance on freshly fallen* <span class='link' data-link='red.md'>*teeth*</span>\
*I want to hurt sometimes*

Imagine an elastic arm\
reaching across the Continental United States\
touching him in <span class='link' data-link='pearl.md'>Tacoma</span>\
At its thinnest point a Sparrow could\
bite clean through it

*Wake up! It is\
already noon and I\
want you to hear this song*

On this side of the country a\
gentle hairless arm with a cigarette burn in it\
rests on my shoulder It is sliding\
against my neck silky with sweat There is\
no friction It is my brother’s arm It is\
My brother
