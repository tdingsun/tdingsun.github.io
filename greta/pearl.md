### Two pearls

Evergreen,\
you open your arms\
reveal seamless chest to wind\
Rise\
through convertible\
window

The air is round\
So full: your legs\
rattle whipping\
in jeans

Room is made for you\
in every fold, crack\
of this highway

Impress, ease me\
into jargon\
Sell it to me\
You, crystallized in browning myth\
You, possessor\
of every superlative

When the longing appears\
hard, unflagging—\
a jade sphere trapped in a ring\
trapped in the basement\
of a cloisonné factory—

You, North Star!\
Evergreen!\
<span class='link' data-link='ode.md'>Pray</span>\
I not be saddened:\
Lottery is lottery is law

Some wealth cannot be shared,\
spread\
like love or delicate butter\
Some wealth is hoarded\
hard, fixed\
A pearl strung on metal thread

Is yours wedged,\
set\
between tracheal walls?\
Do you cough it up and kiss it every night?\
Do you sweeten it?

Would this pearl, mine\
still\
covered in salt\
mother’s saliva\
befit a ring?

Tell me, Evergreen:\
Silent toil claim what value?\
Would this pearl, coated\
only in blood\
fingers’ saliva\
hold?
