### grief tablet (i am washed)

I am washed\
peeled\
Fall through fingers \
Me\
Rice\
under water

It is winter and there\
is nothing\
but\
my coat\
my exposed\
ankles

Invite\
the biting in\
She grab it by collar\
Come in out\
of that night

Coarse shell\ 
fall\ 
away\
will you? She is\
trying\
to teach me\
to emote

Her grief tablet\
is my\
four walls:\
There\
is nothing\
but my coat

Come prepared\
to moment
