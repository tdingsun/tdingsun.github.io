### Ode to Sally II

*A feeling arises from worship and lack.*\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thing: You’ll never know my heart, and maybe this is power. Unpredictable thing, beating incessant, stomp—down—grapes—in a barrel-—when you walked through the crowd. She felt farther away than you did, perhaps a harbinger of things to come.\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Did we ever touch?*\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One god of many in a leotard, a woman lives on a pedestal in my mind. I’m kicking myself for the choices I’ve made.\
<span class='link' data-link='ralph.md'>*Must I unlearn this, too?*</span> My selfishness is disgusting, dry, a hardened mass of saltines sitting in my throat. Difficult to swallow.\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Somewhere, an old man is choking to death on a saltine, he couldn’t reach the panic switch in time. No one came to his aid, he will rot until check-out in a hotel room. You told me the story and I cried in my bathroom. I’m present to a fault, sweating over talking to you.
