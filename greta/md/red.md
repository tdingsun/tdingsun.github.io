### There is a red lake inside my finger


There is a red lake inside my finger\
which I split on a barnacle Today\
I put my eye to the gash\
The water shone pink\
The surface slid The light\
moved like a fleet of extinct animals

Parted the edges (seething inhale) To regard Him\
floating in the center, knees 45 and right and resting\
on a paddleboard\
next to Genghis Khan’s son, Ögedei\
Stately and riding a palace\
carried by four elephants

Pulled white apart To reveal Him\
in underwear\
*How forms can shame us*\
Ögedei in metal\
To slip my hand Between\
His hammered plates\
To thumb that flesh underneath

I, freshly twenty and having just\
<span class='link' data-link='md/ralph.md'>thrown in The Towel,</span> can hear a voice\
A mother’s voice \
lingering in my head’s dank catacomb\
*Isn’t he handsome?*

So due to bereft or excess\
I lay mine on the shore Rest on\
most verdant grown\
by failure to blink back tears and light of Her lamp turned on\
in choice moments

Relegated to land of observer\
Eternal Witness\
To histories and futures and even those\
sitting beside me\
Perched and unnoticing, so close in the backseat I could touch\
the insides of their elbows

I punch at the screen\
Foam at the mouth\
Howl, an offshore baby:\
*Ögedei please I’ll do\
anything for a flake of that striving geode\
Guitarist\
Anything for a shred of that dignity*\
<span class='link' data-link='md/show.md'>*Don’t start the show without me*</span>

But I have never\
been ready I am the dog\
waiting for morning to arrive So I\
can lick my master’s face again
