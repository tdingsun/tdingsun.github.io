### March-May 2018

Ascension passage knotted\
narrow, marled\
Teeth lines\
draw\
from shins\
full measures of <span class='link' data-link='chasing.md'>blood songs</span>

Slick hips\
soak every denim waistband\
Each dissolving stitch\
Lift, float\
stubborn window\
to tarmac

<span class='link' data-link='bench.md'>Kiss milk bowls</span>\
white-hot discs shining in lot\
Snow-melt sneaker\
cracked\
<span class='link' data-link='grief.md'>Painted black</span>\
Shut in cheap acrylic

<span class='link' data-link='chasing.md'>Slap uphill,</span> slung from neck\
nylon straps \
sear pink\
converging lattice\
In attics we polish dust from bridges\
over smoky plywood caverns

In the basement, a photo\
Joe laughs\
Taps white humming beast\
Close air, rubber\
collapse Wet\
collect on lens

Yes, that same Spring\
we drag books\
up sloping New England staircases\
Sweat out everything bad\
Leave our stains\
on all their lacquered covers
