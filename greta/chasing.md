### chasing

A boy in a movie Followed another To a chain link fence laying claim to an empty hill The leaves were on fire that day Stony hands clung to the fence Dead ones And the boy saw the other’s face contort And before you knew it The two of them were thrust against the fence A man held a syringe to their shoulders They made no sounds And time went on like this

After many <span data-link='newyork.md'>injections</span> The man became lazy And the boys escaped They ran with their golden backs slung low to the ground There was gravel and there was dried dirt They made some sound And a Cadillac made sound too, like frothing cream And the man got out and found the small fugitives Crouching in two separate bushes Lawn gnomes looked on As he threw chunks of pumice stone He threw a sledgehammer He missed

Today the boy is grown up He is a leader, he is edified He has eclipsed his past He follows his girl Down a flight of stairs and she says, without looking at him, *You are all I have* and he is stunned He looks at her back They meet in the women’s locker room To kiss and remove each other’s clothes A man looks on A man is always looking on But here he smiles

Now the man is a woman She is someone you know She is someone who tells you what to do And the boy is even older, even wiser So old and wise he is in charge of a cash register and teenagers Sometimes he remembers the Cadillac, the sledgehammer Rarely does he dwell The teenagers look at him like he is god Sometimes, in their eyes, he sees This flickering golden outline His silhouette

One day a Cadillac purrs to a stop The man, here Slams his hand on the cash register The boy says *Sir* and his face is bashed in His nose inverts, sings blood Sings *bloodbloodbloodbloodblood* Here he is, slammed into a counter Here he is, crouched again Slumped in a bush The woman in charge leans over the boy, who cups his hands to form a basin A font for the song flowing from his nose The woman’s face is pillowy, white A blinding sun She calmly intones *Don’t be upset Not all of our stars can align So perfectly*
