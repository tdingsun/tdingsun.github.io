### Orchard Street Bench


Existing sub-happiness cap Something On High placed above my head\
You and I, mollified\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dampened, somehow\
on the Orchard Street Bench\
Or when you whispered poems to me\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;perched on edge of bed, a soft and stable pillar\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;delivering lines someone had dragged\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;into the light and onto the page\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dripping, still beating\
Reciting one you memorized\
the part about a bloody skull stuck with me even though I was raw\
to the morning

*Deepbreath, up!*

After all this I was pushed\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Endured Godâ€™s Maxxed-Out Allotted Shoving\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and kept my eyelids half-lowered, my neck half-loosened\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to better absorb the impact\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the awful, the errant shoelace, the teeth smack on linoleum\
and I sucked the wound, boarded a train car which filled with\
smoke\
& voices of frantic button pressers\
as we were leaving the station and I\
Did not alight but clutched these tickets, these tokens\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior image and current comfort\
I took them with me\
to my poisoned afterlife
