### March-May 2018

Ascension passage knotted\
narrow, marled\
Teeth lines\
draw\
from shins\
full measures of blood songs

Slick hips\
soak every denim waistband\
Each dissolving stitch\
Lift, float\
stubborn window\
to tarmac

Kiss milk bowls\
white-hot discs shining in lot\
Snow-melt sneaker\
cracked\
Painted black\
Shut in cheap acrylic

Slap uphill, slung from neck\
nylon straps \
sear pink\
converging lattice\
In attics we polish dust from bridges\
over smoky plywood caverns

In the basement, a photo\
Joe laughs\
Taps white humming beast\
Close air, rubber\
collapse Wet\
collect on lens

Yes, that same Spring\
we drag books\
up sloping New England staircases\
Sweat out everything bad\
Leave our stains\
on all their lacquered covers
