### Ralph’s / Revenge Document



*I will outline everything you’ve ever called me\
I will lasso and swallow it, that tangled ball of nails\
I will let it spur a hemorrhage*

Watching the returns\
in my cesspool of a bed\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made more rank with each falling tear\
You wanted Low Culture? <span class='link' data-link='ode.md'>Look no further</span>\
I smother myself in it\
A paste worked by some softest hands\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{dirt & venn diagrams & paint to wing the eyes}

At first I found it delightful\
I bloomed in confusion’s halogen bulb\
I thrashed like the show was for me\
I took pictures of everything

Until someone got shot in their bed\
and no one found the body until the blood on the pillow was hard and black\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You could peel it off in one piece\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remove it, bubbled and papery\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pin it to your wall and call it Remembrance

At first I found it scary\
to regard their pointed noses, pink and glistening\
and skin smoked-out dry\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{from years of heaving burning trash onto those below}\
and meaty arm collapsing white and diaphanous shoulder\
as I unfold my ugly ones\
to a chorus of brutish laughter in the ice cream parlor

Heads thrown back in the riot\
Peer through vulnerable nasal passage\
to catch a glimpse of their insides\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{Rank Like Mine}\
and I think, an interior sob:\
*Oh! If the world could see what I saw*
