### Philadelphia Basement Show No. 1

(After Hanif Abdurraqib)

Me by myself and scanning the waters for other Asians My Misguided Ritual and I could hear only the guitars And you know what everyone was nice and I didn’t feel uncomfortable though that seems like a prerequisite for everything these days And all night I felt equal parts devastation and at home and jumpy and my heroes thrashed in front of me, And me too And what a way to forget about optics And Chrissy approached me wearing a backpack in the pit, the handles of a black plastic bag digging into her forearms All I could think while Jac was fruitless chanting was That will surely leave a few creases, Subtle strata linking the tattoos If it were me I would run my fingers over those creases to bring sleep upon myself  But anyway Now my ears are ringing Now this upbeat slings me back So inside the bag were six cans of Miller Lite And she raised her eyebrows which in this moment meant Look Down And I don’t like light beer but I took one just to signify that I was DFA Down For Anything And no I didn’t think about how beer makes me so  ________  No I didn’t I thought about aesthetics and senses and how cold the can felt in my hot hands and how it was sweating just like me, it was sweating its own inanimate sweat And I put it to my dripping forehead as she turned away and extended that gift to someone else And I watched the black bag float into the crowd in front of me, an anchor carried through water this time by its ship
