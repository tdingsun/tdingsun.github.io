          * I squeeze into the back seat of a van with four of my cousins. I am in china and it is summer. They ask me many times if i can understand what they are saying, and I say yes, and I can, but they never seem to believe me. Everytime i see them, it is an uphill battle to become close to them again.
          * 
          * i will never truly know them
          * and they will never truly know me.
          * The huge sort of shadow that my entire family doesn’t know that I’m queer, and that likely my extended family will never know, and also if I did tell them, to me right now it seems like they would never accept or even tolerate that. Part of the reason why I feel this way is because I truly just don’t know them that well. I think only a couple of cousins that I am a little bit closer to would accept it. The anger that I have to ask for acceptance or even tolerance in the first place. The anger that the inevitability of the family unit, and all the anxiety that comes with that, has been ingrained within me.

          Like     * Autotheory
          * “Autotheory” is a term that has emerged to describe contemporary works of literature, art, and art writing that integrate autobiography and other explicitly subjective and embodied modes with discourses of philosophy and theory in ways that transgress genre conventions and disciplinary boundaries. Autotheory is an emergent term, one which began to trend after the publication of Maggie Nelson’s 2015 book The Argonauts, where Nelson, riffing on Paul B. Preciado’s use of the term “auto-theory” in Testo Junkie, inscribed a particularly performative mode of citation alongside a kind of post-memoir, queer feminist life writing text. And yet, autotheory as an impulse can also be traced through earlier feminist performance art, body art, and conceptual art practices, as well as intersectional feminist writings by women of colour like Gloria E. Anzaldúa, Cherríe Moraga, and Audre Lorde. One could argue that the entire history of feminist theory and practice is one of autotheory, though the resonances of “autotheory” as a twenty-first century term bears consideration, particularly when it comes to the twenty-first century context of neoliberalism, late capitalism, and the post-confessional technologies of social media.

        * Imperial states used maps as national logos that could be literally removed from the rest of the world and transplanted onto royal seals, letterheads, or decorations, without context. “Wholly detached from its geographic context … pure sign, no longer compass to the world,” Anderson writes. “Instantly recognizable, everywhere visible, the logo-map penetrated deep into the popular imagination.” This was the same imagery that the colonial state’s “local adversaries,” anticolonial nationalists, like the right-wing Hindu fundamentalist movement in India, responding to the British empire, also came to later use in its reactionary idea of nationhood — “as in an ominous prophetic dream,” Anderson writes.
        * 
        * This practice of mapping assigns physical places with social capital and a social function. Place becomes absorbed into person; it is a function of person, rather than the other way around. Sixteenth-century rulers would hang maps in their palaces to represent the power of the cities they ruled; we, too, integrate our personae with the spaces we occupy, and in some ways own, because we have written these places onto maps. Knowing the actual place becomes irrelevant compared with knowing it in the context of a personal narrative, which requires knowing the place’s social value. We use maps to insert ourselves into spaces, and claim them.

          Deconstructivism seems like a dead end. 

maybe… to say that any instance of imposing order on information is an inherently imperial act.. is a political dead end. So instead what I’ll say is this. im not really sure how much power a graphic designer has. But it’s not nothing. It might be more than we deserve. How are we going to use it?
