var str = "April 1st &mdash; The records of this day are deliberately destroyed. when I close my eyes I see bits of paper drifting down like feathers, down like feathers spilling from my puffer jacket. Trying to isolate the precise and concrete reason, like filtering sediment from a riverbank though a sieve, the reason I feel like a piece of shit all the time. April 2nd &mdash; Tree trunk covered in lichen and moss, you climb, trying to disturb everything the least amount. maneuver over the tineist ant, you accidentally flip upside down, and all the coins you were saving fall out of your pocket, instantly hidden by the ferns and wet rot of the forest floor. April 4th &mdash; Eu-ca-lyp-tus, the syllables sit like beads on a string. Next to that, Ce-dar-wood, it is perhaps today that you will start telling people that things are looking up! April 5th &mdash; A day lain to waste. The corpse of a lamb on the side of the road. Grass grows through it. Opacity slider slows slides fades it away to only checkerboard. April 6th &mdash; Memory of a fall Like balancing on a curb Like gooey preserves Rich, meaty like A scab Like congealed blood April 11th &mdash; My friends like to talk about crying, and crying often, and so I say that I cry too, but this is a lie. The truth is that I can usually only muster up a tear or two in any given situation. Today the hours pass by easily, a breeze fills the room and there is nothing in my ears except the beautiful harmonies of tinny, default MIDI tones. These synthetic tones have no dimension, but who needs dimension? Who cares about depth? Who has the time for complexity? Notes on a pentatonic scale symbolize porcelain. The bow lowers to eye-level, stern, takes flight. Quivers and vibrations, like perfections, rows of pleats all hands on waist. Movement of rushing air like needles or grass, with such precision and sharpness, the first intake of air on a cold, clear, brittle spring morning. Dew dries quickly during those days. April 9th &mdash; A certain tone of voice you return to (shield), A blade so precise like tweezers extracting gunk like plaque from your personality like flossing (sword). April 10th &mdash; Ten thousand years after you die, will there be any remnant of your consciousness left to witness that inevitably heart-wrenching last scene in Wall-E, in which a lone green sprout is found surrounded by the endless landscape of beige rubble? Maybe this dissociation I feel upon impact with the burdens of interpersonal entanglement is because I&rsquo;m craving the feeling of a new beginning. The impulse to disappear becomes stronger and stronger every day. And isn&rsquo;t invisibility is an acceptable strategy? April 8th &mdash; So innundated with the feeling of bordom today. Maybe I just want my life to become more like TV. Mom and Dad are like Mom and Dad only because they try to act like Mom and Dad. The only thing that is real is the love. But the wonders and benefits of the family unit remain veiled, and the propaganda remains embedded. April 13th &mdash; You want reasons to be angry. You gradually become aware of the fact that, the more your thoughts cycle, the more you are constructing a world that gets further and further removed from everyone else&rsquo;s world. You realize that the way you feel about other people does not necessarily reflect who they actually are. You feel like you will never truly understand anyone, and that no one will ever truly understand you. But you try to love and accept the miscommunications of all communication. And you? What are you thinking right now? Who are you thinking about? Who do you think about the most? April 21st &mdash; 1. A sexuality like a sleepy snake, half-falling out of bed, drooling on the floor. 2. A sexuality like a wall, or like a semi-permeable membrane: selective in what gets let in, what gets access. Possibly only a wall to me. 3. A sexuality like a mound of dust. A thin wisp of smoke rises from it, as if from incense that was just blown out. 4. A sexuality like an arrow that has missed its mark &mdash; a vector fully directional, wayward, and unmet. 5. Body pressure, hoping to be absorbed. warm sweat and clammy Impression left in space Memory of a body A pressure An embrace Smell of fresh mulch like... time renewed And beginnings a word like passion a word like potential A word like messiah. April 28th &mdash; Today you unplug your earphones and music continues to blare from your speakers. You imagine the glances from everyone else in the room but you do not dare look up. It&rsquo;s a jolt. This feeling is overwhelming, that your computer should so disregard your intentions. Intense yearning for the day when you can finally play music by yourself, using the chip implanted in your head, when you don&rsquo;t have to rely on things made of metal, glass, and charge, when you can finally become your own iPod (Head rolls back in a motion like a boat or a pendulum. Eyes too). Eras begin and end all the time. As soon as something begins it starts to end.Eternal bliss and tender loins (Am I not having enough sex?). April 29th &mdash; Time like a rubber band. Speak to me and don&rsquo;t speak to me at the same time. I could end it all with a word or phrase, bandied about like nothing, like candy. Call me volatile (I think I am), But your stone-simulation, unstable at best, held together by brute-forced calculated values, will also never be laid to rest. April 30th &mdash; Catapult me out of my body, this world, your voice, like broken-off bits of blades from your x-acto. Catch a glimpse of my name traveling downstream. Bloated pockets of fiery medium like an atmosphere, an afterthought or a vacuum. April 7th &mdash; Tell me all the names of demons, Asmodeus, Belphegor, Beelzebub, also found in various JRPGs, accessible only after endgame, after 100% completion. The latinate sounds linger like antiquity, like preserved ruins, like privilege. These histories of yours evoke a neo-medieval pastoralism in digital terms, reduced to pure aesthetic interest out of spite. Make me a grimoire of all the spells, Demiurge, Leviathon, Mammon, a tome of all the rituals I need in order to become master of both worlds. (Is there even a spell that can do that? What font is it in?) April 15th &mdash; I rub my eyes so hard that watery mucus starts dripping from my nose. My sniffling convinces you that something must be wrong. Dead-end-ness of today no match for eternal return. The banality of recent problems. In the face of others. A phone call away. The delusions of a normative lifestyle (All movies are wrong, there are no real grand narratives). A milestone. Milestones don&rsquo;t feel especially different from any other time. Skeptics don&rsquo;t believe in the observation of anniversaries. No gold, no silver, no wooden rings. Fade like a face encrusted with bark. Tied to a tree spirit. Eventually becoming nothing more than the suggestion of gestalt principles. Didn&rsquo;t you hear? Being a loser is cool now. April 22nd &mdash; The smell of flowers (really, I swear) Like... lemon, maybe. Forest Green Overturn wet, porous logs to find Two or three red salamanders This daily sameness (Huge leaf fills with rainwater in the morning) Static lifeline, in all capacities, in totality. Dust on bone drifting further and further out into space.What next? And who? Everyone is the last person on earth. Misty Rose Visions of enlightenment to be acquired like badges on top of some mountaintop, somewhere. As pure as eternity, like asceticism (projecting gaze outward past allowed focal point) Light: cold, clear, blue Back: stiff Waste deep into a pond A stack of photos A type of contrived sensuality like wanting to draw, so you trace an image from an encyclopedia. Things of such cloying nature like jokes laden with truth. April 26th &mdash; You feel time through the growing length of your hair. Hair like a black lamb, even-lengthen and un-manicured. You pick a dried scab from your scalp, near the base of your neck And parse it out gently by following a single strand of hair. Dark red flecks on your finger like panning for gold. Then you run a fingernail through the ridges of your outer ear accumulating gold, this matter, these crumbs form the tiniest ball and flick it away. April 25th &mdash; Land, sea, sky Twice full of bodies One red, one green, one blue. Extend beyond platitudes. Land A word like halcyon. Describing happiness giving everything a face, a name, and a smile. Sea Opening shot establishes landscape of marshy reeds. Shaky camera pans across horizon line of grays and blues. Craggy rocks and white water. Algae-ic water rivets through sand like cast iron. In the distance a figure in shadow that stumbles. Awake-ness through broken shells under soles. Wisps of hair in salt breeze. Walk backwards into the ocean. Sky Gauze sky, I imagine you solid, and breaking off pieces at will This sky filled with bundles of clouds... I imagine hitting a ceiling. April 27th &mdash; First and foremost, there is the laughter at the ridiculous-ness of your own angst, so badly written, like B-list celebrities, like bubblegum pop. (Break out of your current form). World constantly renewed like world ripping in half like paper like smell of wet wood and lemon and mulch and moths songs that feel like sunsets sunset songs (Not wanting to forget about the loneliness of childhood) Blue light of almost dusk cools down dusty heat blinds half drawn and rocking on a rocking chair staring at the empty wall where a TV used to be. And only the memory of leaves (of that cherry tree, that never bore any fruit), brushing again the window in the swell of early June. A sudden mental leap to an even earlier April, the first time you saw your father cry after hearing about his mother&rsquo;s death, unreachable, on the other side of the globe. I remember being taught how to roll down hills. (Hands tucked close to body) I remember stink bombs and cars crunching on broken glass. April 16th &mdash; Moon so clear-even-veiled by thin clouds, beautiful midnight, blue, purple, orange, yellow sweat keeps me warm. At the spongy track of the high school somehow running with ease but later at home falling asleep I cough and wheeze. Expel the residual smoke of weeks prior from bottom of lung craned neck upwards moon skewed drifting clouds. Thin, uneven cotton gauze, yellow light, red spongy track, green turf Moon craned clear veiled clouds Skewed drifting clouds Thin uneven gauze Yellow light Sponge ground Ruins of lost love Detritus of lost love Fragments of lost love Dust of lost love Memories of lost love Residue of lost love Love and lost love. April 19th &mdash; Embossed, embedded, infused, saturated, permeated, covered with certain words like smart, like beautiful, like talented. These words forms a buffer, and membrane is such gross terminology. Always some sort of barrier or a series of disconnections. A different level of magnitude. Like climbing to the top of a hill only to see a greater peak in the distance. April 20th &mdash; Really I am sorry for breaking blinds for your window. This windless marching towards home. a type of bi-location, plus the novelty of distance. Stories online suggest I talk to you, instead I leave in aquired peace. April";
