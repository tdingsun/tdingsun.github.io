		There is a certain kind of laugh you do &mdash; I might characterize it as a painfully self-aware laugh. It is a laugh that occurs when something is named that you are not used to being named. Sometimes I am annoyed by this laugh. But most of the time it gives me hope. The more of these awkward laughs that you produce, the closer we are to laughing in earnest, right?

		Whiteness is a thing that permeates.

	<div class="draggable bodytext" id="body_text_5">
		And also &mdash; every time a non-white body is scrutinized &mdash; by human and non-human eyes &mdash; is that not a manifestation of whiteness? Of further investing or contributing to a racial visual technology? 
		<br>Avert your gaze.

	<div class="draggable bodytext" id="body_text_6">
		The conversation somehow smoothly pivots to something else. And you are left somewhat disoriented. What was once a conversation about [it doesn&rsquo;t matter anymore] has somehow shifted to an attempt by your fellow interlocutors to maintain, firmly, their identity as non-racists. Of course, they are self-aware enough to know that of course they have committed microaggressions without realizing. And of course they know that irregardless of what they might have meant, of course their words and actions hypothetically still have a negative affect on others (the other). And yet &mdash; but even still &mdash; surely, when we really get down to it, speaking concretely, you can&rsquo;t always disregard intent, right? 
		<br><br>
		<i>Because I really don&rsquo;t think that anytime I speak, in jest, a couple words in Spanish/faux-spanish &mdash; a &lsquo;no problemo&rsquo; here, an &lsquo;ay carumba&rsquo; sprinkled over there, I am subconsciously invoking a larger, more insidious, racialized discourse? </i>
		<br><br>
		You don't think that you are unconsciously invoking racialized discourse?
		So, let me get this straight, you are not aware of something that you might be unconsciously doing?
		<br><br>
		Because if you were, that would mean you are a bad person, right? But I don&rsquo;t believe I am a bad person (who does?) And so that must mean that <i>intent matters. Sometimes, at least, at least, when it comes to my own actions, right? I may occasionally have said something that might have rubbed someone the wrong way, but i didn&rsquo;t mean it, I swear.</i>
		<br><br>
		But what if I told you, that it was never about the question of whether you are a good or bad person. It was never about you in the first place. It was about the effect that whiteness &mdash; through your white body as a conduit &mdash; has on other people. 
		<br><br>
		<i>And yeah, cultural appropriation is definitely a huge issue, and needs to be talked about more, but there are also moments when appropriation leads to a richness of culture. So I don&rsquo;t think the issue is so black and white like this.</i>
		<br><br>
		At this point, you stop talking. You hold your breath and wait for the moment to pass. <i>But don&rsquo;t you see,</i> you want to scream out, <i>that these statements of yours, by virtue of your white body, imply that you are trying to justify moments when you are the cultural appropriator? That what is being scrutinized here is not the mere existence of cross-cultural interaction, but rather how these moments of cultural appropriation align with asymmetrical power differentials? Don&rsquo;t you see that on an uneven playing field, borrowing becomes stealing? Don&rsquo;t you see that these uneven relations of power, that work across so many axes of difference, are made invisible precisely by such generalizing and universalizing discourse such as your own? I agree that there are instances of cultural appropriation that are productive and valid and filled with joy (for example, when they subvert the typical directions of power), and there are ones that are unjust and disquieting. But you seem to think that what decides which instances of cultural appropriation are good and bad is complete randomness. You seem to think that this somehow justifies your thoughts and actions.You do not seem to realize that everything is contingent on history and context.</i>

		* Implications 
		<br><br>
    	* Dear friends,
   		<br><br>
        * I am here to soothe and assure you that it is not your fault that you were born white. But while whiteness is not essential to your being, this doesn&rsquo;t change the fact that you are still white, and will most likely always be white for the rest of your life. Do not forget that. But that also means, since whiteness as a concept is something that exists outside of your self, attacks on whiteness or calls to fight white supremacy are not attacks on your white body. 
        <br><br>
        * You &mdash; are under the auspices of the system &mdash; and that comes with a certain responsibility. I&rsquo;m not so eager to say that whiteness is a sin &mdash; something you are born into, out of your control, that yet you must be burdened by its history. But I might say that whiteness is a responsibility &mdash; you, the one who is so graced by Whiteness Writ Large as being designated as Non-Threatening to Whiteness, have a responsibility to subvert expectations &mdash; and be deemed Threatening to Whiteness &mdash; to be deemed a Race Traitor. Revoke and reject your whiteness &mdash; but know that this is a futile act, at least within our lifetimes. But know that you must try anyways. You must live with this contradiction. An unresolvable contradiction &mdash; unless you decenter yourself. Because ultimately, it&rsquo;s not about any one person. It&rsquo;s about the whole thing.
        <br><br>
    	* Dear friends,
    	<br><br>
    	* I am here to say that the fluctuating and undulating lines of power and identity are so entangled and confused that it is no wonder that you will inevitably get things wrong. I am here to say that it is ok to get things wrong sometimes. I am here to say that maybe you need to accept that you will get things wrong sometimes. It is hard to break free, to dis-align yourself with the establishment. After all, you have a lot to lose.

	<div class="draggable bodytext" id="body_text_8">
		And it is at this point that I stop really believing in this premise.
		<br><br>
		Whiteness as hyperobject? Object-oriented ontology? Give me a break. Looking at whiteness as an identity is obviously still a relevant viewpoint and will probably remain relevant for a very long time. The anger, trauma, and blame for centuries-long histories of incredible violence and domination is not so easily sloughed off just because we see whiteness as a system that exists outside of any body. 
		<br><br>
		But I suppose I still believe in revolutionary love. The white man&rsquo;s burden is really the burden of history. I am making a conscious decision to love everyone. This is not an emotional decision. This is an ideological decision. I choose, despite whatever spur of the moment reactions I may have, to extend people generosity, so that they may extend the same generosity to me. To share with people what I know, so that they may share what they know with me. To give people the benefit of the doubt, so that, when I find myself also somehow aligning myself to hegemony, they may show me the errors of my ways.
