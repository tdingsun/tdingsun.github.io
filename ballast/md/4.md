# Metaphor

There are metaphors for this pushing and pulling, for
this cling and retraction, this tugging and prodding, this examination and identification. Like being pulled in and out of focus, like bobbing under and over the surface of some vast body of water, with no land in sight. Or offering up a piece of your body in hopes of something in return. Or wanting people to look at you, but not for the wrong reasons. Or waiting for the cutie sitting across from you on the train to notice you. Or wanting to be alone but not wanting to be lonely. Or, wanting recognition but also wanting freedom, and wondering if both can exist at the same time.
