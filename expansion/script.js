And who? Everyone is the last person on earth Misty Rose Visions of enlightenment to be acquired like badges on top of some mountaintop, somewhere  as pure as eternity, like asceticism   projecting gaze outward past allowed focal point Light: cold, clear, blue Back: stiff Waste deep into a pond A stack of photos A type of contrived sensuality like wanting to draw, so you trace an image from an encyclopedia Things of such cloying nature like jokes laden with truth  American Drift There is no one around for miles and miles  There are blue mountains in the distance, slightly occluded by build up of thick air via distance, not to mention the heat that shimmers and light  Not to mention the glistens sweet on brow and eyelash, further blueing everything you see  It is bright  You are following train tracks  You don’t remember when or where or why you started walking  You just are  The tracks extends from the east towards the west  They stretch out towards the horizon in both directions  But then, gradually,     the hero    the antihero  the villain    the dancer  the priest    the wanderer  the poet    the judge   A cloud of dust and steam in the distance  A low rumble  A train whistle Your sun-beaten cheeks reveal nothing to me  And then there is the idea of the frontier as a place outside of the conniving confines of society  A place for escape  But what do you know about freedom? You, who dreams of freedom, knows not what it means to be confined  One thousand hands Cold  Core absences in the sky  That's what you see outside your window as you attempt to light a match  After fumbling for a few seconds, you get it, and light the stovetop  The click click and smell of gas coats your senses  The familiar experience of the confluent phenomena becomes another bead on the string  Fingers crumbling dry biscuit  You glance at the sky again, and for a second you swear that the mountain range in the distance did not use to be there  Antihero Glance  Glaze    Gleam        Glisten      Glide Glow  Glory    Graze      Grime        Gristle   Growl  Grin      Groan ordinary social relations are non-existent  cunning and irony   the tricks, deceits, unexpected actions and sarcasm of the hero    and pathos   terror and brutality against the defenseless and against the hero after his double play has been revealed     a sparse composition of pure white clouds and the brightest blue you’ve ever seen     Footage of lasso tricks  Low saturation  Slowed down until the individual frames are made legible, then interpolated so as to recount smoothness again  Turns the lasso into a slow meander molasses of rope, a steady / unsteady circle obliquely and tastefully angled from the camera lens  Cut  Left  Cut  Right  Arm motions in wide strokes, air rendered into thick watery gel  Glowing, floating, pink quartz castle easy-eases up and down  Purple spires and teal moat  Fresnel reflection / refraction, semi-realistic water physics simulation  Specular highlights  A recuperation of obsolete rendering techniques The river water recedes yearly tension  Grey and white checkerboard marks transparency, marks absence, placeholder for context  Assets, and asset management  Leaking / leeching data away  Relentless copying  Antichrist — see, antithesis  Antihero —Furrow —   Brow —Sweat —Jaw — Harmonica, Washboard, Banjo, Jug Individualism we all so value, at its highest market value at moments when landscape looks like wasteland, the earth is cracked and dried, the plants shriveled, no longer green but desiccated olive drab  Curled over itself, the only thing that could be said to be thriving or at least surviving are those dusty prickly pears, and those equally dusty roamers, wayward-ers, nomads, wanderers,Green —  the apocalypse may be about the figure of the antichrist arriving, but afterwards, what is left? When true moral virtue is replaced by the antihero arriving, all rough and tumble and scuffed and rugged, a perpetual furrow in the brow, beads of sweat lingering precariously at the edge of chiseled jaws  Shattered jaws  Rigid jaws Apocalypse — The apocalypse of 1492, after all is said and   not done yet   , and the dust is   not quite settled   , the historical shift in cultural consciousness from commemoration to condemnation, what’s left is the brute forced, hacked, jammed, promise made fulfilled of promised, empty land  Always empty, so empty, except for a few dead pixels that refuse to go away, the residual data persisting, against all odds and all logics evading deletion  The sandy dunes of promise and hope  Figure — figure and background, cherished subjectivity  What’s mine is yours  The desire to be the one who has it all  The birthright of those who survey the land and see jewels hidden in between the ferns, under logs, under loam, covered in moss, covered in lichen, teeming with maggots and ants, pulsating in wild circular patterns  Together they pulsate, the wetware wood seems to pulsate too  Imagining that the hidden roots underground grow and twist and tangle together into one giant network, cybernetics seems so salivation-inducing  But there are hidden costs  Name them DataHuman, coffers of gold, creation and mud, blood, pure power, potential and opportunity  Persuasiveness and pervasiveness  Stubborn  Will  Meat, content  Flesh, alone  My body is held by my own body  Fear of alien invasion fear of not knowing what is not known  Fear of paradigm shifts  Rippling out across the globe  The realization that the pristine edges of a person reveal almost nothing  Going through oscillations between utter derision and begrudging lenience  One thing replaces another  Vaccine Angel, sterile, regenerative but not creative, a mental block  Suddenly every image seems utterly replaceable with every other image Entirely uninteresting, any source of uniqueness merely comes from a different permutation in the ordering of pixels  The image is a lifeless being  I never want to see the same image twice  VirusDemon, those that eat away, demons that afflict you with aphasia, taking away your speech; agraphia, taxing away your ability to write; alexia, waxing away your ability to read  Bitter occlusion, blocked vision  All I want is to gaze, is a gaze, is to be allowed to gaze  Land, sea, sky Twice full of bodies One red, one green, one blue  Extend beyond platitudes LandA word like halcyon Describing happiness giving everything a face, a name, and a smile Sea Opening shot establishes landscape of marshy reeds Shaky camera pans across horizon line of grays and blues  Craggy rocks and white water  Algae-ic water rivets through sand like cast iron  In the distance a figure in shadow that stumbles  Awake-ness through broken shells under soles  Wisps of hair in salt breeze  Walk backwards into the ocean   Sky Gauze sky, I imagine you solid, and breaking off pieces at will This sky filled with bundles of clouds…I imagine hitting a ceiling  FallFall, especially now, as you look back at your time at this institution and you wonder if it has stripped you of any opportunities at intimacy, or if it was you who did not take the opportunities as they presented themselves to you, or if you even ever wanted any of that  The dying that takes place all around you, and the rotting, the fermentation, the compost, the worms, the freezing over, the bite, the redness, the ruddiness, the dripping, it all feels exactly like what it feels under your thinning skin, which hardens and becomes brittle, and as you head into darkness you think, is it a matter of being? Or of feeling? Or of wanting? Winter Winter, but then, as the season progresses, and everything retreats, you realize that the perfect shells of your friends and acquaintances are merely a veil for the same type of pain as yours, or maybe an even more intense version, and suddenly the pain you feel seems so inconsequential  Or maybe not inconsequential, but entirely ordinary  This is embarrassing, but also a relief  It is now when you are going through waves of utter derision alternating with begrudging lenience, that you see groups of college students huddled in street corners, happy and shout-ing, and you think, they are so boring, and whiteness is so boring, and you are so bored  And you are perversely thankful for access to a pain which they will never know, and you think that maybe the pain of alienation is worth the fact that you will always be infinitely more interesting than these people, with their thin lips and translucent skin, they seem so fragile  You default to a feeling of hatred and demand to be proven wrong SpringSpring, when the world around you is most distinct from your inner self  It was during this time that you discovered desire, but the only way you are able to talk about it is by removing the subject entirely  All that is left is the feeling, the action, the mode of being  Desire is a mode of being  It is constant  You are disgusted by hetero-romantic love and its arrogance  You wish to be arrogant  Spring is when opportunities arise, and even watching those float past you in vain is its own form of pleasure Desire, and the only thing you desire is for desire to be articulated, and you think, more pop songs, please, more and more pop songs  Summer Summer, when you are most likely still separated from your family, who still know nothing, and combined with the old feeling of freedom that comes with summer vacation is a vast and intense loneliness — alienation from your parents who know so little about your life, not for want of trying, but because of your own fear of strife  Not to mention, the structure of the rest of the year dissolves and leaves you floundering, and it becomes so hard to get from point A to point B  You are suddenly afflicted with totalizing inertia  You refuse to articulate the pains of being queer, you are tired of the cliches and tropes of alienation, you only want to convey  self-confidence, acceptance, and an unapologetic nature, but the fact is, for you   and you can only speak for yourself   , summer is when being queer feels most painful  Even the nights, which you thought would offer cool reprieve, remain balmy, and give nothing to you  Separated, and you go back and forth between wanting and not wanting to be separated  Because your mother called you and in a quiet voice and with more vulnerability than you have ever heard from her, she tells you that she is sorry for certain moments when she had been too stubborn or too angry, your mother, who is fiery and was born in April  The thing she fears the most is distance, physical and emotional, from her three children, and the thing she hopes for the most is only increasing closeness as her three children stumble their way into adulthood  You, too, feel a yearning  But you are afraid that there will always be an irreconcilable distance, a lack of understanding that might be impossible to overcome  There is nothing that you want more than to be who your parents want you to be, an indignant rejection of the instinct you learned from college mental health advocates and YouTube lifestyle vloggers to put your own needs first  Loneliness, but you know that everyone is familiar with the specter of loneliness  And that thought in itself is a relief  You wish you could be okay with being alone  Balmy, the constant hum of the air conditioner becomes a part of you, the honeyed shadow that is cast over you  The sweat seeps into your sheets  Relief, like rubbing an ice cube on your fevered skin Specter, but you don’t believe in ghosts Honey, like nutrition, like love, like sweat, like forever  Shadow, like glowing, like pinprick, like seeping through, like connection Fevered, like a frenzy  Belief, like money  Ghosts, like television  Nutrition, like powder Forever, like nothing Pinprick, like a beginning Seeping, like sewage  Wanderer This one is like, okay, so, not knowing where you’re going, right? But going and going and going anyways  This one is alone  Stoic? A little bit? This one is lilac  A lone flower in a field of grass  This one wears a cloak  This one has muddy boots  Priest This one wears a hat, for sure Maybe also a cloak  This one is white and gold  This one has a hard interior  This one does the spiritual work of telling you, to a certain extent, how the world works, and how to feel  Poet This one is wiley, a hack, a coward  Is dreamy, intelligent but somewhat lazy  Good at singing, a deep purple or maybe a green  This one is a fool but knows it  Waits for their next meal eagerly  Only dependable when it really counts  This one uses melodies as buffs and weapons  Thief This one is a brownish-grey  Also wears a cloak! Small feet, nimble, two short daggers… heart of gold? The foil, the anti-hero  The one who loves talking/not talking/always alluding to/always hoping someone asks about their troubled past  A dull ache — laughter  Miraculous night, silent night, holy night, holy trinity, as I look up into the star-filled sky, forgive me for I have lied  Lied in order to get what I want  Made concessions but not amends  Making split-second decisions and pretending that that was the plan all along  Wanting to seem independent but all actions rely on someone else’s movements Words coded in such a way so as to reflect well on the speaker  Words that make you seem smart  Imagine a grotto  Something revealed at low tides when the water rushes back to the sea  Standing in three inches of ice cold water  Drips on your shoulder  A casual sign  A cinematic moment  A thin membrane  In front of you is the craggy opening, revealing the midnight ocean gleaming under the light of the full moon  The stars are in perfect alignment with each other  Gleaming  Foam and detritus wrap around your ankles  Seaweed creeps up your calves  Dragonflies buzz, graze past your ear  A myriad of sighs from last year  Hushed tones  The particular articulations of a French pop star singing in English  Hidden energy  Tidal water, cesspool  Crumbling limestone  If you licked, it would taste salty  Residual particles  Encrusted  Growths  The true cesspool of hum  A take—sea caves, twinkling but slow  Localized arrhythmia  Constellations … something special about the beach  Grain after grain after grain  A beaded necklace  Moments strung together  Pale yellow  Cornflower blue  Peach  Lavender  Beige  Orange  Indigo  Forest green  Red  Amber  Cerulean  Eucalyptus  Cedarwood  Lichen  Algae  Something to be said about the way it feels — not real — when drifting   in and out, like tides    like in and out of a fever dream  It must feel like how it feels to stop playing a video game  Suddenly everything is rendered inconsequential  Not relevant anymore  But time remains so terrifying to me  The thought one day my bones will be exposed to bare dirt  My skin should sag and reach the ground There is no longer a desire to say anything novel  There is only the desire to reiterate old cliches, to dwell in tropes, to relish in trite sentiments  There is nothing to say because nothing ever happens  I vow to abhor world-building in favor of complete self-annihilation  I will always be unresolved, and the feeling of not being will always be— 1  A sexuality like a sleepy snake,  half-falling out of bed, drooling on the floor 2  A sexuality like a wall, or like a semi-permeable membrane: selective in what gets let in, what gets access  Possibly only a wall to me  3  A sexuality like a mound of dust  A thin wisp of smoke rises from it, as if from incense that was just blown out 4  A sexuality like an arrow that has missed its mark — a vector fully directional, wayward, and unmet 5  Body pressure, hoping to be absorbed   warm sweat and clammy Impression left in space Memory of a body pressure An embrace Smell of fresh mulch  like… time renewed And beginnings  a word like passion    a word like potential A word like messiah 1  Always so depressing in the cramped isolation of a 6 hour flight, the recycled air pushes you further and further within yourself  Being ten thousand feet in the air, you see your entire life stretching out in all directions, and your tired and frazzled brain can only pass the time by taking stock of everything you’ve ever done, everything you’ve ever thought, everyone you’ve ever met  You tell yourself that it’s a depression that you crave, this vast and lonesome introspection  You tell yourself that it’s useful to take inventory: who do you love, who do you want to spend time with, what’s stopping you   2  Leave the room  Figure A goes to the other room to pretend to take a nap  Figure A feels disappointed always  There is nothing left but disappointment  As A lies in bed alone, A hears Figure B talking to Figure C, talking and laughing, outside the room  Eventually the voices quiet and A suspects that B and C have left  Figure A has decided not to feel this way anymore  Above all, A refuses to do things that makes A feel pathetic  6  A thinks B is so cute! A thinks that everything B does is so cute, that every part of B’s body, and every one of B’s mannerisms, are so cute  A feels like A will always love B  B is like the cutest puppy, and at the same time a brother, and at the same time the cutest cat 5  A feels like this is working  A is optimistic that this is enough  A rereads the notes A had started writing since about a year ago, up until yesterday  Always there is a level of remove  A hates the idea of seeing A’s entire life stretched out in front of them  A hates making mistakes  A loves emptiness and feels a deep affiliation with the void  A does not think this is incompatible with the pursuit of a fulfilling life  A realizes that some people may not understand this  A methodically rips each page of notes into smaller and smaller bits, and throws them all away  I The “I” that I encounter when I am alone  I walk alone down the hill, snow everywhere, blinding  I close my eyes  I feel weighted, stones in my pocket, I stop and almost never continue walking again  I experience totalizing inertia  The “I” that is the desire-ing subject that I sometimes feel as if I am merely observing  The “I” that is full of desire  Desire pulls me forward  Identity is not about what I am, it’s about what I want  The “I” that approximates most closely the benchmark of authenticity  The “I” that I claim to be the real “I”  WeWe love that  We’re really thinking hard about that  We’re really interested in your work  We’re all going out  We go there all the time    Psst    We wanted to tell you something  We reach into our pockets for nothing to give  We’re licking the bowl  We’re washing the laminate  We forgot what we were going to say  We hate that  We really hate that  We don’t really get it  We guess we just don’t get it  We really wish you would stop  We really just can’t YouYou want it to be summer  You want it to be summer and you want to be eating a whole watermelon, digging your spoon into the candy-red flesh  You want sweat to drip down your brow  You want papaya and milk and ice  You want to do nothing but lay on a cool bamboo mat while the breeze rustles the parched leaves outside the wire-screen door, feeling a light but consistent sheen of sweat all over your body, your body that sticks itself to the mat, the ice melting in your drink and condensation forming on the side of the glass  You think of memories of deep summer during the first signs of the snow melting in early March  You feel intense desire for a time defined by the instinctual non-productivity   HeHe gets pulled into a spiral of removed shame and recognition  At this point, it feels familiar  He wants to stop fantasizing about tragedy  He recognizes his own faults but does nothing to change them  He has no access to the experiences of other “he”s  His “he” is a “he” based on signal and lack  SheShe is someone who doesn’t want to go outside anymore  She, who makes up grammars and deploys them with deftness  She is bloodless, cold and bright, like the most reflective day  She pretends to have a personality  She tries to cultivate a rich inner life  She is tired of the endless rhetoric  The mere thought of having to maintain a manner of speaking drains her of all life  She wants to remain low to the ground  She notes your tireless need to be idiosyncratic and finds it exhausting  It Was always unable to look at the fish that would lay flat on its side  Braised in sweet juices, pools of oil in black vinegar underneath would splash and stain the tablecloth, thin slivers of ginger and scallion covering like a second set of scales  Would have to sit obliquely so that it’s hard eye was clear from my view  Its sharp translucent jaw too, and its split open gills  Not so certain now why it disgusted me so much They They wished that the mutual lineages and linkages of desire would find their natural course and causes, but instead they laid inert like two logs on the forest/ocean floor  Oscillating between turning towards and away from each other And, One, Spine, Try not to  consider me a friend  There doesn’t seem to be an end to this feeling of … this impossibility of fulfillment, and, Two, Gutter, and the image grows more and more distinct from ground truth  Confusion and nothing better to do than to sink deeper into a sort of muddied, abstract impulse towards self-negation  Foreign is the feeling, instead of something being slightly twisted, slightly warped, seems flexible but ultimately impenetrable  Transgression is impossible  There is always the play and bending of boundaries, but there is one that will always be insurmountable  At the base of this hill the only actions are to cower and live, And, Three, Block, and a path opens up towards how things are as they are, and recognized is the desire to know everything is still strong, and more space, and more boundaries, and the verbalization of truth feels really exciting, a love that is vast but not overbearing, And, Four, Spread, again and again I come back to that word peal it rings in my head  Lighter towards the horizon flocks bell peal, that word peal, that beautiful word, a purity is suggested, resonates, look, up there with the sky lifted up, sky the sky the skies all the skies the skies the sky sky, And, Five, Cover, come here, please, and, parting ways, and wondering, and replacement, And, Six, Binding, and, insatiable, the conscious decision to repress something, being tired of wanting more, an entire year’s time, that familiar, constant frothing between optimism and pessimism, And, Seven, Head, and devoid of feelings, sighs, words, gazes, effacement, exorcism, indication, setting traps, facilitation, And, Eight, Tail,   and there is no longer a desire to say anything that has not been said before  There is no longer a desire to avoid cliches,   And, Nine, Joint, and winter nights spent standing at cliff's-edge, internal timers ringing, rustic settings and citrus scents, selfish and self-indulgent, And, Ten, Index, and this morning, an encounter with the impulse to take down every image on your walls, every image feeling totally interchangeable with the next  No happiness in holding objects, much less owning them  Not sure when this happened, when this instinct to empty and clean took over   possibly when Marie Kondo got a Netflix deal   , a theme of stillness and emptiness and a foreclosed future rings heavy and true, doesn’t matter how contrived it feels  Value is of your own making  There is a power in that    April 1st The records of this day are deliberately destroyed  when I close my eyes I see bits of paper drifting down like feathers, down like feathers spilling from my puffer jacket  Trying to isolate the precise and concrete reason, like filtering sediment from a riverbank through a sieve, the reason I feel like a piece of shit all the time April 2nd Tree trunk covered in lichen and moss, you climb, trying to disturb everything the least amount  maneuver over the tiniest ant, you accidentally flip upside down, and all the coins you were saving fall out of your pocket, instantly hidden by the ferns and wet rot of the forest floor  April 4th Eu-ca-lyp-tus, the syllables sit like beads on a string  Next to that, Ce-dar-wood, it is perhaps today that you will start telling people that things are looking up!April 5th A day lain to waste  The corpse of a lamb on the side of the road  Grass grows through it  Opacity slider slows slides fades it away to only checkerboard April 6th Memory of a fall  Like balancing on a curb  Like gooey preserves Rich, meaty like  A scab  Like congealed blood April 11th My friends like to talk about crying, and crying often, and so I say that I cry too, but this is a lie  The truth is that I can usually only muster up a tear or two in any given situation  Today the hours pass by easily, a breeze fills the room and there is nothing in my ears except the beautiful harmonies of tinny, default MIDI tones  These synthetic tones have no dimension, but who needs dimension? Who cares about depth? Who has the time for complexity? Notes on a pentatonic scale symbolize porcelain  The bow lowers to eye-level, stern, takes flight  Quivers and vibrations, like perfections, rows of pleats all hands on waist  Movement of rushing air like needles or grass, with such precision and sharpness, the first intake of air on a cold, clear, brittle spring morning  Dew dries quickly during those days  April 9th A certain tone of voice you return to   shield   , A blade so precise like tweezers extracting gunk like plaque from your personality like flossing   sword    April 10th Ten thousand years after you die, will there be any remnant of your consciousness left to witness that inevitably heart-wrenching last scene in Wall-E, in which a lone green sprout is found surrounded by the endless landscape of beige rubble? Maybe this dissociation I feel upon impact with the burdens of interpersonal entanglement is because I’m craving the feeling of a new beginning  The impulse to disappear becomes stronger and stronger every day  And isn’t invisibility is an acceptable strategy?April 8th So inundated with the feeling of boredom today  Maybe I just want my life to become more like TV Mom and Dad are like Mom and Dad only because they try to act like Mom and Dad  The only thing that is real is the love  But the wonders and benefits of the family unit remain veiled, and the propaganda remains embedded April 13th You want reasons to be angry  You gradually become aware of the fact that, the more your thoughts cycle, the more you are constructing a world that gets further and further removed from everyone else’s world  You realize that the way you feel about other people does not necessarily reflect who they actually are  You feel like you will never truly understand anyone, and that no one will ever truly understand you  But you try to love and accept the miscommunications of all communication  And you? What are you thinking right now? Who are you thinking about? Who do you think about the most? Tell me all the names of demons, Asmodeus, Belphegor, Beelzebub, also found in various JRPGs, accessible only after endgame, after 100% completion  The latinate sounds linger like antiquity, like preserved ruins, like privilege  These histories of yours evoke a neo-medieval pastoralism in digital terms, reduced to pure aesthetic interest out of spite  Make me a grimoire of all the spells, Demiurge, Leviathan, Mammon, a tome of all the rituals I need in order to become master of both worlds    Is there even a spell that can do that? What font is it in?     I rub my eyes so hard that watery mucus starts dripping from my nose  My sniffling convinces you that something must be wrong Dead-end-ness of today no match for eternal return The banality of recent problems  In the face of others  A phone call away  The delusions of a normative lifestyle   All movies are wrong, there are no real grand narratives     A milestone  Milestones don’t feel especially different from any other time  Skeptics don’t believe in the observation of anniversaries  No gold, no silver, no wooden rings  Fade like a face encrusted with bark  Tied to a tree spirit  Eventually becoming nothing more than the suggestion of gestalt principles  Didn’t you hear? Being a loser is cool now In defense of the proliferation of stock images in the world, on billboards, digital displays, advertisements, canvas prints    They stretch and expand until each pixel is revered at the same level as a religious icon on a shrine The way beeswax smells slightly of honey, this index, like the way your hair always smells like coconut A photorealistic paint-by-numbers rendering of the Eiffel Tower Three blocks of wood painted painted with the words live, laugh and love  Generic inspiration quotations sewn into the hem of pillowcases  Motivational posters hung in bathrooms, positioned strategically to be in your direct line of sight as you sit down to use the toilet  You feel time through the growing length of your hair  Hair like a black lamb, even-lengthen and un-manicured You pick a dried scab from your scalp, near the base of your neck And parse it out gently by following a single strand of hair  Dark red flecks on your finger like panning for gold Then you run a fingernail through the ridges of your outer ear accumulating gold, this matter, these crumbs form the tiniest ball and flick it away Really I am sorry for breaking blinds for your window  This windless marching towards home  a type of bi-location, plus the novelty of distance Stories online suggest I talk to you, instead I leave in acquired peace Embossed, embedded, infused, saturated, permeated, covered with certain words like smart, like beautiful, like talented  These words forms a buffer, and membrane is such gross terminology  Always some sort of barrier or a series of disconnections  A different level of magnitude  Like climbing to the top of a hill only to see a greater peak in the distance April 28th Today you unplug your earphones and music continues to blare from your speakers  You imagine the glances from everyone else in the room but you do not dare look up  It’s a jolt  This feeling is overwhelming, that your computer should so disregard your intentions  Intense yearning for the day when you can finally play music by yourself, using the chip implanted in your head, when you don’t have to rely on things made of metal, glass, and charge, when you can finally become your own iPod   Head rolls back in a motion like a boat or a pendulum  Eyes too    Eras begin and end all the time  As soon as something begins it starts to end Eternal bliss and tenderloins   Am I not having enough sex?    April 29th Time like a rubber band  Speak to me and don’t speak to me at the same time  I could end it all with a word or phrase, bandied about like nothing, like candy  Call me volatile   I think I am   , But your stone-simulation, unstable at best, held together by brute-forced calculated values, will also never be laid to rest  April 30th Catapult me out of my body, this world, your voice, like broken-off bits of blades from your x-acto  Catch a glimpse of my name traveling downstream  Bloated pockets of fiery medium like an atmosphere, an afterthought or a vacuum  Moon so clear-even-veiled by thin clouds, beautiful midnight, blue, purple, orange, yellow sweat keeps me warm  At the spongy track of the high school somehow running with ease but later at home falling asleep I cough and wheeze Expel the residual smoke of weeks prior from bottom of lung craned neck upwards moon skewed drifting clouds  Thin, uneven cotton gauze, yellow light, red spongy track, green turf Moon craned clear veiled clouds Skewed drifting clouds Thin uneven gauze Yellow light Sponge ground Ruins of lost love Detritus of lost love Fragments of lost loveDust of lost love Memories of lost love Residue of lost love Love and lost love stash messed moody moan gate chest ram hem eyed tarry slice fused stoke lacked reap favor hoof thaw two form but delight rile nib bide niece siege flick scale wail duel scope peck lewd bulge sift jarred grand dingo gauze curl gout lain meld weave current shaves pea high leak dice laid frill cap spun vase bombed arise lie tan gore collusion bathe wall freaked often lease sown bicker acid befuddle largess collaborating nutritious provisionally conventional jerked attend tech musculature profane propane notation fan sun lower older shine finery chalked sowed hoof supermarket sheer tail lead couch sail keen winnow shines banned spine vie eon me diverse sod gas pack swell prepay prop ant on he remain roam nurse realized fare woos bellowing as hoe edit and poster design, oh realize kin load weighted pile dome Driving back from that pond in Arcadia: Do you feel like there’s something missing in your life? It definitely feels that way, but right next to that feeling sits another, clearer realization that there might actually be nothing missing from my life, that this first feeling is just a feeling  Maybe both can exist at the same time What more do you want?I guess the things I want are the things that I perceive others have and I don’t have  But I constantly have to remind myself that there’s no such thing as   or at least shouldn’t be    a model for what a life should have, which means that technically there should be no way for something to be missing from my life  What do you have?I have my friends, my family, my body, an education, the ability to pay my rent, a place to sleep, a 13-inch MacBook Pro   What don’t you have? A 15-inch MacBook Pro [laughs]  Should I call my mom now, or talk to her when I go home?It seems like you want to call your mom now The way the highway stretches out in front of us makes it seem like we are going somewhere, but we’re really just driving home  I hate the idea of living my life modeled after some hetero-romantic paradigm found in the TV shows I’ve watched, and I hate the idea of living my life as after the likes of cis-white-gay-men like Dan Savage and how dare he be the first person in my life to tell me that it gets better  What does he know and why can’t there be someone, anyone else The landscape was all shrubs and sky  We miss our exit and take the next one  The only way I am able to distract myself from one problem is by focusing on another    First and foremost, there is the laughter at the ridiculous-ness of your own angst, so badly written, like B-list celebrities, like bubblegum pop   Break out of your current form   World constantly renewed like world ripping in half like paper like smell of wet wood and lemon and mulch and moths songs that feel like sunsets sunset songs  Not wanting to forget about the loneliness of childhood   Blue light of almost dusk cools down dusty heat blinds half drawn and rocking on a rocking chair staring at the empty wall where a TV used to be  And only the memory of leaves   of that cherry tree, that never bore any fruit   , brushing again the window in the swell of early June  A  sudden mental leap to an even earlier April, the first time you saw your father cry after hearing about his mother’s death, unreachable, on the other side of the globe I remember being taught how to roll down hills   Hands tucked close to body   I remember stink bombs and cars crunching on broken glass A city built on a bog  The pavement melts and sticks to the soles of your knock-off Adidas sneakers  A part of town full of dust and putrid canals  Thick fog like a shelf near the horizon, dreams of giants, spires and ugly renaissance-revival buildings Ivy and cramped, brickwork and lace, my parents always say that the US barely has any history compared to the 5000 years of Chinese history  That doesn’t seem to stop the sense of legacy A mound rising up, on top is a tower, on top of the tower is a man raising both hands up towards the sky Parting clouds and a single sunbeam  Horizon glancing off airplane wing  Mark the soles of my feet with words of power  As I walk they wear down to nothing but in the meantime I have protection  Gilded frame around everything you see, the edges are barely there, your gaze never deviates Something left behind, like ruins, detritus, shards of glass, dust  An impure emptiness caked in residue and dirt   This is a scene you’ve seen before  As your eyes scan across the room, it is almost as though you can trace the emanating lines of desire from each body  As if these pulsating lines were a UI overlay on top of your field of vision  As if Google Glass ever saw commercial success  Very cyber  So painfully directional, these lines, so sharp are their arrows   and so blunt are their hacked tails    And then, of course, there’s the question of your own desire, which feels like a specimen to be pinned up needle sharp and examined, its wings so crisp and symmetrical  An object towards which an intense but detached fascination is directed Even you think these feelings of yours are tiresome, like tumblr posts tagged wanderlust, tagged stardust, like tweens ascribing world-reckoning profundity to the smell of asphalt after it rains, or to the supposed un-translateable-ness of certain words  Boring wanderlust, boring schadenfreude, boring petrichor, boring undeniable desire  AliceBlue Cold is so airy and bright, the sun is freezing and blinding AntiqueWhite Paper crumbles, history is negated Azure The color of the digital horizon Beige The most soothing, pale wallpaper fading in the sunlight  Dappled sunlight on skin Bisque Brick, soup, kiln  Earth and clay, formation, the smell is the strongest thing about you  Not unpleasant, but always present Black Oh, its you, old friend, safe and inescapable  Your presence and absence feel the same, not knowing what I’m missing until it’s gone  Blue A crutch, surefire trigger for the feeling of pure digital-ness, this is the color of the waves when you surf the web  Blue Violet Tool in a toolbox… mailbox…Pressed flowers passed on for progeny to find Brown Warm and understood, a sheen and a richness and a fakeness like bars of chocolate preserved in resin  Burlywood An average color, a color of low potential energy, the mother color, all other colors fated to return to the embracing arms of this one Chartreuse Disgusting liquor you once had me try, a novelty at best  The color of nausea Coral Like bleached red, dead things we are obsessed with and draw pictures of Cornflower Blue Beautiful only because you told me so Cornsilk Bury half my face in your hair Crimson There are certain moments when the city feels known to me, like I know the shape and design of every manhole cover  And then there are those moments like cigar smoke and heavy cologne  I can only think of that word ‘club’, like citizenship, like city and suburb  Cyan A fun person, if somewhat unapproachable at first  Like a Scandinavian pop savant Dark Blue Almost sickening, like sucking on plastic toys  The smell of a McDonalds play pen Dark Cyan Aging plastic and dental equipment DarkGoldenRod Taste of a bronze sculpture  Touching paintings at museums when nobody is looking FireBrick Crumbling scalloped edges Floral White Tape and foam Forest Green Crepuscular rays abound Fuschia The coldest flower, like frost and car-sickness  The faintest smell of vomit from stains from years ago GhostWhite Like devils, pale as sand, they take everything HotPick Remember that gum that would come in the shape of a roll of tape?Ivory Something sinister, like fake teeth and shock-white hair and blue eyes Linen Visions of an ideal summer before the grime of the sidewalks and the walls of subway stations settle on you Old Lace That specific smell, dim lighting and doilies and candy left in bowls for decades  You naively have one and get a stomachache later that night Olive Pants, shirt, and jacket  PapayaWhip Candied diaspora dream boy  PeachPuff Children’s toys with integrated online universes  The joke of getting shadowbanned from club penguin  Plum Novelty gummy candy squirts syrup all over your white shorts  PowderBlue Following with your eyes the metal tracks from which the hospital curtains hang down, you imagine the entire recovery ward turning into a labyrinth  RebeccaPurple The feeling of loss in the pit of your stomach, always and forever  RosyBrown My mother had one shade of lipstick  SeaShell Disappointing fragments found instead of whole carcasses, distributed sharpness under feet  Blasted with sand on the back of your ankles  Sienna An ode to horse girls — and stickers on binders, etchings made in tree bark, white-water rafting on family vacations, and aligning oneself with the leisure of camping SkyBlue Lift me up to the window and see the bells ring they peel  Slate Blue Rubbing a stone until your hand feels like someone else’s  Slate Gray Shards of suburban life to carry with you wherever you go  Snow Tiny little pale pink flowers  slowly become embalmed in crushed ice Thistle Woodland childhood characters and the promise of ice cream being made out of a mixture of the fresh fallen snow and honey  I remember PBS being the only channel available to me  I remember feeling intensely the luxury of Nickelodeon Tomato Institutional dining halls meant to be scoffed at but in a loving way, soup in white plastic bowls; shatterproof  Wheat Chaff comes back to haunt you  White A pillar of pure energy surrounds a pedestal with nothing displayed on it, no one can get close  WhiteSmoke A circle with 5 randomly chosen points on its perimeter, each one acting like an escape valve for something roiling inside  YellowGreen One of the most deeply embedded nuances of childhood: Two crayons, one labeled green-yellow and the other yellow-green, and they look the same but come out as vastly different colors  There is nothing like the encroaching balminess of early summer  You want for your shirt to be dampened with sweat  You want for your hair to cling to your face, for every surface to be slightly sticky, for every photo in your iPhone to be blurry  On this gloriously unproductive summer day, there is only the sound of rustling leaves, the feeling of being hot and full of friction, and you do nothing but lay on cool, wood-paneled flooring that leaves impressions on your body You want to feel the relief of rubbing an ice cube over your fevered skin  You want beads of sweat to lingering precariously at the edge of your brow  You want to wake up in the mornings with the sun already unbearably hot and bright, and your white sheets thoroughly dampened…It’s like this — Do you remember the subway station at 14th and 8th? How unbearably hot it gets in the summer  Down in that station, the blaring heat makes everything shimmer, and even your ears get sweaty, causing your AirPods to slip out and fall onto the tracks  And that was the end of all music  Music, like love, like dancing, like sex, like sprinting towards forever  I look out the window and I see a caterpillar! Fuzzy, green, cute little caterpillar  I am so happy because it reminds me that spring is finally here  It’s been a particularly dark winter  I fractured my finger, all my house-plants died, and my favorite cereal got discontinued    Anyways    Happy that spring is here!
