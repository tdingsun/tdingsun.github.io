# Study

We talk about our Asian identity as assumed, as given, as matter of fact. Talked about frankly, it is only theoretically the locus of some sort of American blockage or lingering eye.

The other day, I came across a study from the University of Washington that found that queer Asian-Americans
are perceived as being more American than their more heteronormative counterparts. I had to think about this one for a long time. I couldn’t decide how to feel. The study offered an explanation: because Western countries generally had more progressive LGBT politics than most countries in Asia, queerness is read as more Western, and possibly more individualistic. We all know how much the Western world values the individual: the will to change lies within yourself, and it’s your fault if you can’t manage to pull yourself up by your bootstraps.

The extrapolations of these findings were unsettling. Does this negate the existence of a queer Asian identity outside of Western conceptions of what it means to be queer? Is the model of queerness that I currently operate under inherent and specific to the West? Is being queer therefore a form of assimilation? Does this mean I’ve forsaken my Chinese roots? Dishonored my mother and father? But what roots, exactly, are we talking about here? To a certain extent, I dis-identify with everything. I’m not sure which facet of my identity is responsible for this dis-identification, or if that even matters.
