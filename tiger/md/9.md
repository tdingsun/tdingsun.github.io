# Rain

The light outside turns from orange to blue, and future instantaneously becomes codified into past. One minute later, thirty minutes later, and then an hour, then two, threeâ€”the hours feel like days.

Once in a while there comes a day where there is nothing to do but waste away and fade into the surrounding landscape, like a defeated NPC in a video game, the opacity of its sprite representation turned down to zero before being deleted, leaving no trace and no memory. The surfaces around me repulse this negation. I can only respond to their relentless and cruel aspirations with pragmatism. Rain leaves dark streaks on everything concrete. Beautiful in that way, a beauty adjacent to both nothingness and ugliness.

*I miss you, will you call me sometime?*
