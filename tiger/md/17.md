# Salve-maker

Dearest salve-maker, did I imagine that?

Or, as the beach heather rustles—okay, in the wind—the dogs barking like the dawn, the sun that rises paradoxically in the same place where it set the night before. The waves like delineations, each crest a white line on the sand. The stars like poppy seeds, stars so numerous they swarm around like bees. This old dog, and the dawn of inexorable approach.

I am a cave, a cavernous cave, empty but for water dripping and birds chirping, and flocking, birds flickering in and out of the entrance of this cave. This cave is the passion. A level of intimacy with myself so intense, I just sigh.
