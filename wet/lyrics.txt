Tell me, baby, tell me slowly All the things you couldn't show me Tell me one more time before I leave Now I see you never knew me Look at you, you look right through me Tell me one more time before I go I don't believe you when you Say you love me most And when you tell me I'm the only one And I can't feel you when you're touching me and telling me That this time you want all of me And you won't hear me when I'm Telling you it's all or nothing All or nothing, baby please Let go of me, let go of me When you say you love me, baby Let me see your face And when you say you'll never leave me Know it's all in vain And these memories, they haunt me Wherever I go Tell me, baby, say it slowly All the things you never showed me Tell me one more time before I leave Now I see you hardly know me I learned your way, I learned so slowly Take another shot, but you'll miss me I don't believe you when you Tell me that you love me most And when you tell me I'm the only one And I can't feel you when you're Kissing me and telling me That all my fears are in my head And you won't hear me when I Tell you that it's all or nothing All or nothing, baby please Let go of me When you say you love me, baby Let me see your face And when you say you'll never leave me Know that it's all in vain And these memories, they haunt me Wherever I go If I could be stronger And if you were just older We might last this out longer But the task just gets harder And my face turned to red From drinking all that dead water And then again when you said That I was my mother's daughter Shaky when he comes to me Shaky but I believe Shaky and I'm on my knees There are better things for me Shaky when I came to be When they left, they left me in pieces Shaky, but I believe There are better things for me If my legs were longer They might carry us further But we waited too long And so the task just gets harder And the thoughts that come in They come on stronger and stronger And it takes all of me To just stay out of the water Shaky when he comes to me Shaky but I believe Shaky and I'm on my knees There are better things for me Shaky when I came to be When they left, they left me in pieces Shaky, but I believe When you left, you left for a reason Ohhhh, take me to the things I see I see My eyes can reach passed all that's been laid out for me Shaky when he comes to me Shaky but I believe Shaky and I'm on my knees There are better things for me Shaky when I came to be When they left, they left me in pieces Shaky, but I believe There are better things for me ...It's just not right, it's I don't wanna be
