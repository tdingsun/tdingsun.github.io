# Introduction

I think I’ll start with that tired question of graphic design and authorship.

I turn to contemporary discourse in the field of translation, where there is the idea that interlingual translation – what we think of as translation writ-large (from one language to another) – is an act of authorship, as the translator inevitably has to make countless decisions in creating the translation. There is no such thing as a perfect translation, no platonically ideal translation of a text. The point of a translation isn’t, and can’t be, perfect imitation, but instead is to give new life and new meaning to an original text.

Insofar as graphic design is fundamentally structured around the act of intersemiotic translation, graphic design is authorship.

So this question of “are designers authors” isn’t actually that interesting, and also probably isn’t actually the locus of this debate. Afterall, copywriters still author texts, it's just that they are authoring texts in service of a brand. The anxiety of the graphic designer comes from feeling as though their entire field is stuck between being an artform and a service industry. 

What I *am* interested in is the poetics, the frameworks, and the tropes used by literatures like poetry or speculative fiction in order to engage their readers with worlds with their own internal systems of logic – worlds which relate to ours, but also lie within a field of hybridity and contradiction. Beyond the idea that graphic designers can also be authors, and that graphic design can be authorship, my goal is to outline a methodology for graphic designers to develop an awareness of the *poetics* of their authorship, the *potential* of worldbuilding of their authorship, and the potential and poetics of *worldbuilding in general.* Poetics – how a text’s different elements come together and produce certain effects onto the reader – sounds a lot like what graphic designers are also concerned with, and offers the possibility for graphic design to function in other ways than just providing the most efficient visual translation of information.

# Graphic Design and Poetics

There are already many things that the field of graphic design and poetry share. Poetry seeks to make new meaning through novel configurations of elements (words) from an already established system (language). Graphic Design, being related to the organization and presentation of information, can also be seen as making meaning through novel configuration of various elements, which are not just limited to language and text, but also might include images, symbolic meaning, and visual culture writ large.  Poetry, more so than other literatures, is concerned not only with the denotative meaning of words, but also the meaning that arises from the aesthetic quality of words (things like phonaesthetics, sound symbolism, rhyme, metre). In dealing with typography, graphic designers are also interested in both the denotative meaning and aesthetic qualities of a text they are working with. Both have a playful relationship to structure, sometimes adhering to, and sometimes breaking, form. 

However, one thing that graphic design does not often do, that poetry does, is making a world. This is extremely worthwhile for graphic designers to pursue, because worldbuilding allows for the potential for narratives to sprawl out nonlinearly. It invites a non-teleological reading (reading without a prescribed goal) of the text, (or image, or whatever the object of graphic design is).

# A Methodology for Worldbuilding

![Worldbuilding](md/1.png)

In poetry, this is done differently for every poet, but in general one could describe it as a complex interaction between systems of cultural and historic signifiers and a poet’s own idiosyncratic, hermeneutic system of symbols, images, and other poetic devices, as well as their own logic of how those symbols relate to one another. After all, I would imagine that most poets want their texts to be somewhat understandable by their audience. By combining signifiers that are already familiar to their audience with more personal narratives, images, and symbols, The poet creates entry points into a poet’s psyche. This is related to what the artist Ian Cheng might call ‘worlding’. Cheng writes on his [website](https://worldto.live/), 

> “Worlding [is] a vital practice to help us navigate darkness, maintain agency despite indeterminacy, and appreciate the multitude of Worlds we can choose to live in and create. Whether you are creating art, games, institutions, religions, or life itself: LIVE TO WORLD AND WORLD TO LIVE!” 

He further writes in another [blog post](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2019/03/05/worlding-raga-2-what-is-a-world/):

> We could say a World is something like a gated garden. A World has borders. A World has laws. A World has values. A World has dysfunction. A World can grow up. A World has members who live in it. A World gives its members permission to act differently than outside of it. A World incentivizes its members to keep it alive, often with the pleasures of its dysfunction. A World counts certain actions inside it as relevant and meaningful. A World undergoes reformations and disruptions. A World has mythic figures. A World is a container for all the possible stories of itself. A World manifests evidence of itself in its members, emissaries, symbols, tangible artifacts, and media, yet it is always something more.

What’s most interesting to me here is this interplay between constraints and possibilities. Poets constrain their work using various structures, but also build upon and selectively break apart those structures by incorporating their own idiosyncratic use of language. Through offering both references to (perhaps multiple) systems of shared references and collective knowledge and one's own personal frameworks, poets create new worlds from this combination of different shared frameworks for interpreting reality and the poets own personal reality, worlds that the audience is able to semi-inhabit, and explore over time.

This suggests a methodology that might be of use to graphic designers. Although creating novel structures and novel logics to govern our making necessarily limits any semiotic elements that have to adhere to these structures, these structures also imply the existence of an expandable world within which that logic holds true. The key here is this combination of “internal” and “external” (of which there may be many, which may contradict each other) systems of meaning. This is one way to view the way poets develop their own sense of poetics—how the different elements of a text all fit together, and produce both linguistic and extralinguistic (sensorial? synesthetic?) effects onto the reader. Graphic Designers, too, can develop their own visual language in the same way that a poet might develop any number of poetic frameworks through which to interpret reality, by fitting together multiple external and internal systems of meaning. We are already adept at invoking widely shared, conventional systems of meaning in order to make our work function on the basis of clarity, but it is also possible for clarity to exist simultaneously with another, murkier kind of effect that comes from fortifying conventional logic with a graphic designer’s own internal logic. 

I might call this methodology “hybrid worlding”, to emphasize the fact that these worlds, which graphic designers and their audience cohabitate through their work, are made up of many other worlds, and are richer because of this multiplicity. Under the methodology of hybrid worlding, there is a call for epistemic disobedience, as the decolonial theorist Walter Mignolo calls it, for we all operate under symbolic systems of oppression. As graphic designers we have the ability to take those pervasive systems and strip them for parts, combining them with other, more marginalized knowledge. We can take what has been deemed ‘esoterica’ or ‘folk’, and give them equal importance with conventional structures of knowledge, this so-called ‘rationality’ or ‘common sense’ that has been naturalized. So much of what is considered ‘good’ or ‘correct’ or ‘legible’ design comes from these naturalized conventions. Part of this methodology of “hybrid worlding” involves the possibility of co-opting the aesthetics of structuralism, while recognizing it’s inherent arbitrariness, and to see that this arbitrariness is in fact emancipatory, and enables us to layer multiple logics and systems of knowledge. There’s an opportunity here to mine history and culture of various frameworks (responsibly, of course, but here is where I’ll invoke my identity as a queer designer of color operating in the Western world, to say that I am interested in both co-opting white knowledge as well as utilizing structures from my own culture. This is why, for example, I am interested in both Taoist cosmology, as well as the aesthetics and lore of Christian mythology, even though I have absolutely zero cultural connection to Christianity), as inspiration for organizing content, and for developing one’s own individualized visual language.

# Demons, Folklore, and Speculative Fiction

<span class="caption">*Sigils for the 72 Demons in the Ars Goetia*<span>

“Hybrid worlding” also has a relationship to sacred geometry, to numerology, to mandalas, magic circles, to cosmologies, to mythos. These are all old frameworks of graphically organizing the universe and all that it contains, and how it all functions. One form of “hybrid worlding” might be for graphic designers to draw visual and compositional inspiration from mysticism. Consider the five elements used in many traditional Chinese practices to explain various phenomena. Consider the four humors, used in medieval Western European theories of anatomy. Consider, for example, the Ars Goetia, that Western medieval taxonomy of 72 demons. Each of these 72 demons were associated with their own sigil, and they obviously weren’t called graphic designers back then, but some graphic designer had to create these sigils, these compositions of line, circles, and crosses. By associating this system of sigils with an already existing lore around demonic organizational hierarchy, this designer is able to connect their (somewhat arbitrary) designs with the existing Western eschatological tradition, loading whatever they are making with the invitation for the audience to step into a world where texts and graphic symbols operate under some hidden logic, and have greater power than in conventional reality. 

Sci-fi and fantasy writers have been doing this sort of thing for a while now, to create worlds that are new and yet related to ours. It has also been commonly troped in many anime franchises. “Hybrid worlding” also definitely owes a lot to the genre of magical realism, especially in the way that magical realism often operates through epistemic disobedience, by disrupting conventional logic and reasoning. Many of these narratives operate under fictional structures and power systems that draw from various cultural, historical, and religious/spiritual/mystical frameworks, while combining that with other logics and inventions that expand upon those already existing frameworks, in order to flesh out the world in which their narratives play out. 

More literally, this relationship between fictional worlds and broader culture and history is evident in the fact that much of worldbuilding heavily references various world mythologies, folktales and religions (everything from Thor in the Marvel Cinematic Universe to vampires and werewolves in the Twilight franchise), but in a way that flattens it and makes it more malleable. It’s like secularized mysticism, or playful mythos. And what is mythos if not just  narrative and epistemological frameworks for understanding the world? But this play with culture also happens at various levels of abstraction. For example, elemental systems (like in Pokemon, or Naruto, or Avatar the Last Airbender) originate from any number of different theories of the atomic makeup of matter (the four classical elements of fire, water, earth, air, the 5 elemental system in east asia of fire, water, earth, metal, wood). Or the taxonomic system in Digimon coming from a more recent, technological framework of relationships between data, viruses, and vaccines. Other examples include references to tarot cards (Cardcaptor Sakura, Persona 4, Shin Megami Tensei), chakras (Naruto), different musical genres (Trolls World Tour), taxonomies of virtues, personality traits, or emotions (Digimon again, inside out), divisions of labor in society (Hunger Games) or different theories of the relationship between mind, body, and soul (too many to count). 

There are all of these ways that writers expand a world through it’s lore, and the great thing about that is that building up a lore suggests the existence of even more lore, that just happens to have not yet been made explicit to the audience, and is open to speculation. This is the kind of thing that fuels fandom. What if graphic designers could create worlds capable of garnering fandoms and fan theories? It would mean a depth of engagement that graphic designers always seem to be reaching for.

# Expanding the Limits of Graphic Design

![Worldbuilding](md/4.png)

If Graphic Designers only rely on a set of conventions and references that are legible to the dominant culture— to the lowest common denominator, then they will inevitably just create things that are meant to be consumed as efficiently as possible, and nothing else. However, on the flipside, if designers only rely on the most inaccessible parts of their psyche, their work will be completely useless to others. The field of graphic design is oriented towards the public, and therein lies its strength. But it can be easy to forget that a public is made of individuals, and it can be hard to create things that both offer up entry points for the audience, and broadly opens up a field of interpretation. 

![Worldbuilding](md/5.png)
<span class="caption">*Poetry and speculative fiction already do this. Graphic designers can, too.)*</span>

A world and a spectator necessitates a framework with which to make sense of it all. As graphic designers, we deal with visual and textual structures, frameworks, and hierarchies all the time. So why not start making our own frameworks? “Hybrid Worlding” helps the graphic designer maintain cohesion in their body of work without feeling one-note. Because if the graphic designer develops a rich, hybridized, internal logic through which their body of work functions, even without explicitly explaining that logic, the audience is able to slowly piece that together, and excavate the lore of the world that is created.

It bears clarifying, that this methodology is not one that tells you to throw away all structure, to throw away all of your legacy Western European Graphic Design education and sensibilities. It is a methodology that tells you to provincialize that education, to consider it just one tool out of many possible tools, one structure out of many possible structures. This methodology is not one that is anti-structure. It is pro- multivarious and contradictory and ambiguous and poetic structures. 

As an analogy, I might say that this methodology is not one that says to make and then ultimately break the grid. Because the truth is, I, and most other graphic designers, like grids. So instead of breaking the grid, I want to make the grid my own, to claim its aesthetics for myself, and to imbue the grid itself with rich layers of connotative meaning and custom logics. The “hybrid worlding’ version of a grid is a grid that binds itself to the texts and images that lay on top of it, wrapping around it and becoming the bones of a world. And the audience doesn’t necessarily have to understand it all. The paradox is that clarity can, in fact, co-exist with poetic ambiguity and the openness of interpretation. Legibility can co-exist with illegibility. This ambiguous structure (or perhaps structural ambiguity?) signals to the audience that there is a world here, and that it is worth engaging with, and even if they can only catch a glimpse at first, there are hidden depths to discover.
